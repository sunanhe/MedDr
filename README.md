## Release
- [04/23] ðŸ”¥ We released **MedDr: Diagnosis-Guided Bootstrapping for Large-Scale Medical Vision-Language Learning**. We developed MedDr, a generalist foundation model for healthcare capable of handling diverse medical data modalities, including radiology, pathology, dermatology, retinography, and endoscopy. Check out the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.xxxxx).

## Environment

We build our model based on [InternVL](https://github.com/OpenGVLab/InternVL). Please refer to the [INSTALLATION.md](https://github.com/OpenGVLab/InternVL/blob/main/INSTALLATION.md) to prepare the environment.


## Demo
Download the [checkpoint](https://huggingface.co/Sunanhe/MedDr_0401) and change the `model_path` in `demo.py`.

```Shell
python3 demo.py
```
